I did not write any source code for this paper: the exception is one Python file discretizing the longitude class for Aviation Accidents: LongitudeDiscretizer.py
Otherwise, all other code and analysis was done using the latest stable version of the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), provided for free by the University of Waikato.

Installation:
1. Install Java 8 JDK
2. Install the latest stable version of WEKA
3. Open WEKA GUI and Explorer
4. Run experiments

Where to find my files:
- everything should be pretty straightforward; all the code for the algorithms that I used was provided with WEKA
- original datasets and LongitudeDiscretizer.py are included in Datasets/
- the results of various experiments are included in Results/
- the dimensionally transformed datasets with clustered attributes included are found in ClusteredDatasets/

Parameters and other requirements for performing the experiments should be included within the paper, wma61-analysis.pdf itself.
